Best Practices for MongoDB:

    Use Proper Indexes: Always index frequently queried fields to improve performance.

    Avoid Large Documents: MongoDB has a document size limit of 16 MB. Use references if your documents are likely to grow.

    Use Aggregation for Data Processing: Offload data processing to the database by using MongoDBâ€™s powerful aggregation framework.

    Backups and Replication: Ensure you have proper replication and backup strategies in place for high availability and disaster recovery.
    
    Connection Handling: Ensure proper error handling for database connection issues.
