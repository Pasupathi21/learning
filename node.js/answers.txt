NODE.JS

stream,buffer and binary in node.js
    Binary:
        Binary data is contain 1s and 0s stored in memory (eg: docs, images, audio or videos)

    Buffer:
        - Buffer is designed to handle binary data
        - Buffer is not a data type
        - Buffer is fixed size 
        - javascrit can't handle binary data only handle string, so Buffer can interact the binary data

    Stream:
        -

Event Loop:
    i) call-stack  ii) event-loop  iii) callback queue  --> micro and macro queues

concurrency and parallelism in node.js

    concurrency -> run multiple taskS within the single thread at same time (achieved by EVENT LOOP)

    parallelism -> run mutliple task with worker thread(multiple thread) like CPU intensive process,
                   cluster module will create child process (it means new RUNTIME INSTANCE ) it will perform tasks in
                   parallely, each process communicate with IPC(inter process communication). and also cluster will use same port for all child process
